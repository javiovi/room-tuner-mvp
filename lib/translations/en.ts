    rt60: "RT60 measures how long it takes for sound to 'die out' after a hit or note. A low value (< 0.4s) means a dry room, ideal for recording. A high value (> 0.8s) means lots of echo, like a bathroom or church. For music listening, the sweet spot is between 0.3 and 0.6 seconds.",
    rt60Low: "Low frequencies (bass, kick drum): the hardest to control and the ones that bounce the most.",
    rt60Mid: "Mid frequencies (voice, guitar): where the human ear is most sensitive.",
    rt60High: "High frequencies (cymbals, brightness): easily absorbed by curtains and rugs.",
    proportions: "The proportions between length, width and height determine whether sound distributes evenly or builds up in certain areas. A square or cubic room is the worst for sound. Proportions that differ from each other (e.g.: 1.0 : 1.4 : 1.9) are ideal.",
    problematicModes: "Modes are frequencies where sound bounces between walls and gets amplified or cancelled. Imagine waves in a pool: at certain points the water rises a lot and at others it stays still. The same happens with sound in your room. These modes cause exaggerated bass in some areas and silence in others.",
    frequency: "This chart shows how your room sounds at each frequency. The ideal line would be flat (0 dB). Peaks upward mean that frequency sounds louder than normal, and dips mean it sounds quieter. The flatter the curve, the more faithful the sound.",
    flatResponse: "The 0 dB line represents 'perfect' sound: all frequencies at the same volume. It's the ideal target.",
    dbThreshold: "Decibels (dB) measure volume differences. ±6 dB is a clearly audible difference. If the curve goes outside this zone, it means that frequency is playing too loud or too quiet.",
    roomModes: "Room modes are frequencies where sound bounces between parallel walls and reinforces itself. It's like when you sing in the shower and certain notes sound much louder: that's a mode. The red bars are the most problematic and the ones that need the most treatment.",
